<h1>About Me</h1>
<p id = underTitle>I am Ryan Landry, a game developer from Pittsburgh, PA. My portfolio consists of full game examples, code samples from released games, and assets I have created for my games. While my focus is on the coding and development side, I also have extensive experience in unity level design and Pixel art, which allows me to be an asset in all aspects of a design team. My work demonstrates a commitment to producing high quality games and assets and I am eager to bring my passion for game development to your team.   </p>
